Lift Chart
===================================

Lift is the ratio of the number of positive observations up to decile using the model to
the expected number of positives up to that decile based on a random model. Lift chart is the chart between the lift
on the vertical axis and the corresponding decile on the horizontal axis. Lift chart displays a plot of Cumulative Data Fraction and Cumulative Lift.

Cumulative Lift

•	Y-Axis shows the cumulative lift which displays the compared improvement that a model gives for a random outcome through a lift score.

Cumulative Data Fraction

•	X-Axis is the Percentile for example, a cumulative data fraction of 0.1 equates to the top decile, or the 10% of records with the highest scores.
